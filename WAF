LAB:
1. Install and Configure the Web Application Server:
  Install a web server (e.g., Apache, Nginx) and a database server (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) on the designated VM.
  Deploy a simple web application (you can use vulnerable applications like OWASP WebGoat or DVWA for testing).
2. Set Up a Basic Network:
  Configure the network settings to ensure communication between the web application server and the WAF.
  Use host-only or NAT network configurations to simulate a local environment.
3. Install and Configure the Web Application Firewall (WAF):
  Install your chosen WAF software on the second VM. For example, ModSecurity is a widely used open-source WAF.
  Configure the WAF to filter and protect the web application from common web vulnerabilities.
  Define rules to block or log suspicious traffic.
4. Test the WAF:
  Simulate attacks on your web application to observe how the WAF detects and handles them.
  Use tools like OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, or manual testing to inject SQL injections, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other common vulnerabilities.
  Monitor the WAF logs to analyze its behavior and effectiveness.
5. Fine-Tune WAF Rules:
  Adjust WAF rules based on your testing and observations.
  Understand how different rules impact the WAF's ability to detect and prevent attacks.
  Experiment with various settings to optimize the WAF for your specific web application.
